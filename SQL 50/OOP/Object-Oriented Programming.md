### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 
> - Object-oriented programming is a paradigm (* and not a specific language*) centered around the concept of objects. It is a way of structuring a program by *bundling* related properties and behaviors into individual objects.
> - *Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors).*
> 
> - So what is *the paradigm* --> **An approach and mindset of structuring code, which will direct your coding style and technique.**

>- A [[Programming Paradigm]] is a fundamental approach or style of programming that provides a set of principles, concepts, and techniques for designing and implementing computer programs. It defines the structure, organization, and flow of the code, as well as the methodologies for problem-solving and expressing computations.

### CLASS
> - A class is a **blueprint** ( *Standard Or Template* ) of an object. You can think of a class as a concept, and the object is the **embodiment** of that concept. You need to have a class before you can create an object.
> - A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.

### Object

> - An object is a *single instance of a class*, which contains data and methods working on that data
> - *Objects are instances of classes, which can contain both data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors).*

### [[Encapsulation]]
> - **Encapsulation** is the concept of *wrapping* data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can help prevent accidental interference and misuse of the data. Access to the data is typically provided through methods.

### [[Inheritance]]
    
> - **Inheritance** is a mechanism by which one class (called a child class or subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent class superclass or base class). 
> - For more simplicity --> **Inheritance** is the mechanism that binds two classes in a parent-child relationship. In this relationship, the child can access all the properties and methods of the parent.
> - This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
>- *The biggest draw of OOP is its inheritance property.*

### [[Polymorphism]] 
- **polymorphism** is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types)
-  الكائن يمكن أن يتخذ أكثر من شكل، والفكرة ببساطة أن مجموعة كائنات ترث خصائصها من أب واحد، لكن كل منهم يقوم بتعديل هذه الخصائص لـ تقوم بأمر مختلف.

### Abstraction 
> - **Abstraction** is the concept of *hiding the complex implementation details* and showing only the necessary features of an object. It simplifies the interaction with the object by providing a clear and simple ***interface.***
> - It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming.
