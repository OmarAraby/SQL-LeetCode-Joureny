-->  **Inheritance** is a mechanism by which one class (called a child class or subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent class superclass or base class). 
> - For more simplicity --> **Inheritance**Â is the mechanism that binds two classes in a parent-child relationship. In this relationship, the child can access all the properties and methods of the parent.
> - This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
>- *The biggest draw of OOP is its inheritance property.*
