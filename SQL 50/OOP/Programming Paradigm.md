> - **Imperative Paradigm:** Specifies how to perform tasks step by step.
> - **Declarative Paradigm:** 
> 	- Specifies what the program should accomplish without describing how to achieve the result.
> 	- Describes the desired result, not the control flow or state changes.
> 	- **Examples:** SQL, HTML, CSS.


### Imperative Paradigm 
#### Procedural Programming

- **Concept:** Focuses on procedures or routines (functions) to operate on data.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Organizes code into reusable functions.
    - Follows a top-down approach.
    - Emphasizes a clear sequence of steps to achieve a task.
#### [[Object-Oriented Programming]]  (OOP)

- **Concept:** Organizes code around objects, which combine data and behavior.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Uses classes and objects.
    - Supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

#### Structured Programming

- A paradigm aimed at improving clarity, quality, and development time.
- Uses structured control flow constructs like loops, conditionals, and subroutines.

### Declarative Paradigm  
#### Functional Programming

- **Concept:** Emphasizes the evaluation of functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Functions are first-class citizens.
    - Encourages immutability and pure functions (functions with no side effects).
    - Supports higher-order functions (functions that take other functions as arguments or return them).
- **Examples:** Haskell, Lisp, Scala, Erlang.
#### Logic Programming

- **Concept:** Uses logic and inference to derive conclusions from facts and rules.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Programs are written as a set of logical statements.
    - Uses a declarative style where the focus is on what should be achieved rather than how.
- **Examples:** Prolog, Datalog.
