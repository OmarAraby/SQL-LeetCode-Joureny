**File-Based System (FBS)** 

> An early Method of managing data using individual files stored on a computer . Each application program within a file-based system manages its own data files, leading to a decentralized approach to data management




**Disadvantage of FBS**
		1. Difficult to Search
		2. Low Performance 
		3. Separated copies
		4. No Relationship 
		5. No DB Integrity
		6. Data Redundancy --> Duplication of data 
		7. Data Inconsistency --> Multiple version of files
			1. Due to redundancy, any changes in data need to be replicated across multiple files
		8. Long Development Time
		9. Security & Permissions
		10. Constraints & Rules 
		11. No Data Quality (Plain Text)
		12. Manual Backup & Restore 
		13. No Standard 
		14. Difficult Integration
